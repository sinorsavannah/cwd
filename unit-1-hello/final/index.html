Complicating matters is that a Maquis (a paramilitary terrorist organization) ship was sucked into the Delta Quadrant with Voyager. Both ships sustained heavy damage and casualties, forcing the crews to combine and work on the USS Voyager (which survived in better condition). Far from home and stuck with friends and foes alike, Janeway must beat insurmountable odds and lead her people back to Earth.</center></td>

			<div><center><p>Captain Janeway is the first female captain to headline a Star Trek TV show. Her first mission on Voyager is to locate the missing Maquis ship, <em>Val Jean</em> in the Badlands. During this mission, both ships and their remaining crew become stranded in the Delta Quadrant. Unable to contact Starfleet, Captain Janeway makes numerous choices that could mean the difference between life and death. From joining forces with the Maquis to making first contact with numerous civilizations, she spends her time making difficult decisions.</p>
			<p>She is characterized by her hard, rigid decision-making process, which can be called uncompromising. She adheres strictly to the rules, especially the Prime Directive and crew safety. Throughout the course of the show, Captain Janeway makes many tough decisions and does not tend to be swayed by her crewmen. This has led to fans coining the phrase "Janeway or the highway," recognizing Janeway's strong leadership style.</p></center></div> </td>

Shortly after graduating from Starfleet Academy, he was dishonorably discharged from Starfleet for covering up a piloting error. Afterwards, he briefly joined the Maquis only to be arrested by the Federation and imprisoned in the Federation Penal Settlement in New Zealand. While serving his sentence, Captain Janeway pays him a visit and offers him a choice: stay in the camp and serve out his sentence <em> or</em> join her on Voyager as the pilot and help track down the Maquis. Paris decides to join the crew, and for the rest of the show, his character goes through much growth and is redeemed.</center></div>
