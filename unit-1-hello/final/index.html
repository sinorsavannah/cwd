	About this page:
	I am a fan of Star Trek, and Voyager is my favorite of the Star Trek TV shows, so I decided to make a website inspired by it. Also, since Voyager was originally released in the 90s, I thought it would be an appropriate choice of subject matter for a website inspired by '90s-2000s websites. I used Comic Sans and table format (to make it blockier) to make it feel a bit more retro. I used orange as my main color scheme because it was bright and reminded me of some sites I saw on Geocities (like https://geocities.restorativland.org/Hollywood/Screen/2171/). I tried to match my shade of orange to the orange in the engineering picture I used to make it a bit more cohesive. The background image was selected because I wanted something from the show's intro, and that image fit well with the color scheme. I also included a lot of images and gifs to make it feel a bit more fun and like a fan site.

Complicating matters is that a Maquis (a paramilitary terrorist organization) ship was sucked into the Delta Quadrant with Voyager. Both ships sustained heavy damage and casualties, forcing the crews to combine and work on the USS Voyager (which survived in better condition). Far from home and stuck with friends and foes alike, Janeway must beat insurmountable odds and lead her people back to Earth.</p>

			<div><center><p>Captain Janeway (played by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Mulgrew">Kate Mulgrew</a>) is the first female captain to headline a Star Trek TV show. Her first mission on Voyager is to locate the missing Maquis ship, <em>Val Jean</em> in the Badlands. During this mission, both ships and their remaining crew become stranded in the Delta Quadrant. Unable to contact Starfleet, Captain Janeway makes numerous choices that could mean the difference between life and death. From joining forces with the Maquis to making first contact with numerous civilizations, she spends her time making difficult decisions.</p>
			<p>She is characterized by her hard, rigid decision-making process, which can be called uncompromising. She adheres strictly to the rules, especially the Prime Directive and crew safety. Throughout the course of the show, Captain Janeway makes many tough decisions and does not tend to be swayed by her crewmen. This has led to fans coining the phrase "Janeway or the highway," recognizing Janeway's strong leadership style.</p></center></div> </td>

Afterwards, he briefly joined the Maquis only to be arrested by the Federation and imprisoned in the Federation Penal Settlement in New Zealand.

Eventually, the Doctor becomes more than just a hologram to Voyager. Evolving into an individual with thoughts and feelings, as well as a full member of the crew and the Chief Medical Officer. His storyline delves into the rights of holograms and what it means to be a person.<center></td>
